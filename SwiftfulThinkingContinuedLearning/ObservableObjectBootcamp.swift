/*
    âœ… In SwiftUI, managing state thatâ€™s shared across multiple views requires tools that extend beyond the State property wrapper.
    âœ… This is where ObservableObject and ObservedObject come into play.
    âœ… ObservableObject is a protocol that SwiftUI provides for objects that can be observed for changes.
    âœ… When you mark a class as conforming to ObservableObject, youâ€™re signaling to SwiftUI that this objectâ€™s properties, when changed, should trigger a refresh of any views that depend on them.
    âœ… Any properties marked with @Published in an ObservableObject will automatically notify the view to update when they change.

    ðŸ”´ ObservableObject
        â†’ a protocol
        â†’ A type of object with a publisher that emits before the object has changed.
        â†’ By default an ObservableObject synthesizes an objectWillChange publisher that emits the changed value before any of its @Published properties changes.

            1.   The ObservableObject protocol is used with some sort of class that can store data.
            2.   The @Published property wrapper is added to any properties inside an observed object that should cause views to update when they change.
            3.   The @ObservedObject and @StateObject property wrappers is used inside a view to store an observable object instance.

         class UserProgress: ObservableObject {
             @Published var score = 0
         }

         struct InnerView: View {
             @ObservedObject var progress: UserProgress

             var body: some View {
                 Button("Increase Score") {
                     progress.score += 1
                 }
             }
         }

         struct ContentView: View {
             @StateObject var progress = UserProgress()

             var body: some View {
                 VStack {
                     Text("Your score is \(progress.score)")
                     InnerView(progress: progress)
                 }
             }
         }
